       Include all sniffs in the PHPCompatibility standard. Note that the
       path to the standard does not have to be specified as the
       PEAR standard exists inside the PHP_CodeSniffer install
       directory.

    <!--
       Include all sniffs in the PHPCompatibility standard except one. Note that
       the name of the sniff being excluded is the code that the sniff
       is given by PHP_CodeSniffer and is based on the file name and
       path of the sniff class. You can display these codes using the
       -s command line argument when checking a file.
