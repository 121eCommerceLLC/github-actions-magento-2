       Include all sniffs in the PHPCompatibility standard. Note that the
       path to the standard does not have to be specified as the
       PEAR standard exists inside the PHP_CodeSniffer install
       directory.

    <!--
       Include all sniffs in the PHPCompatibility standard except one. Note that
       the name of the sniff being excluded is the code that the sniff
       is given by PHP_CodeSniffer and is based on the file name and
       path of the sniff class. You can display these codes using the
       -s command line argument when checking a file.

           Magento often uses classes whose name is `Attribute`, but these classes are in the namespace,
           for example: `\Magento\Catalog\Model\ResourceModel\Eav\Attribute`.

           But at the moment there is a problem in the standards.
           @see https://github.com/PHPCompatibility/PHPCompatibility/issues/1291

           After fixing this problem, the exception can be removed.
